# Scripts

A collection of useful scripts for various tasks.

Hosted online so I can download them when needed rather than relying on local storage / USB sticks.

# Usage

Each script is standalone and designed for specific tasks. To use a script, simply download it and run it in the appropriate environment. A description of each script is in the script itself.
